An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

The Kickstarter Campaign Data was used to help Louise decide what category of things to begin a funding campaign as well as when she should begin. 
Using the data, charts were made to help visualize and help Louise in her decision.

Based on the Parent Category chart, it is shown that Theater Kickstarter Campaigns are one of the most successful.

However, to find whether a campaign in theater is beneficial to Louise, a look into the Subcategory outcomes was necessary.

From the subcategory chart, one can see that plays were far more successful in comparison to the rest.

The last bit of information for a successful kickstarter campaign was to find when other successful campains launched.

By using the chart as a reference one can suggest that Louise begin her kickstarter campaign in the second quarter of the year, preferably in June.
