# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis was to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the trend of theater kickstarters throughout the years and when they began, it is apparent that many succeeded during the month of May and it would be beneficial to those wanting to start a theater kickstarter in that month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The best amount that was set for a goal on a kickstarter that is a play was set at less than $5000. The next best range of amounts was between $35000 and $44999. The first range had a high percentage which landed between 70-80% while the second range at the higher goal amount was between 60-70%. The analysis also shows that there is a great percentage of kickstarters failing due to having a high goal set. This can be seen where goals are set between $25000 to $34999 and from $45000 and above.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The only challenges faced were having to find the right way to organize the data in the pivot table as well as figuring out how to fully narrow down the information needed for the the Outcomes Based on Goal. 

## Results

It can be determined that the best time to begin a theater kickstarter would be to have it launch in the month of May and to avoid the month of December. 

There are many plays that have a high rate of success when they have a low goal set for them.

It would be great to find out how successful the plays are based on the launch date so as to see what the amount is set for the goal to the theater kickstarters in every month.

Another possible type of graph that would help visualized things would be to used a stacked column graph for the outcomes based on launch date so as to see the amounts in each month in relation to its success, failure, or cancellation.
